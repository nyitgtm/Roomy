- Students can book multiple rooms
- View their current, previous, and future bookings
- Change their profile info (email, password)
- Cancel study room bookings
- View Messages sent by Faculty

## Faculty

- view all study room bookings
- each booking display student name and ID (and room information / timestamp)
- send messages to students
- Delete / reject study room bookings
- Update room availability

##Admin

- Create Faculty accounts
- Delete student / faculty accounts
- Manage all study room bookings (approve/decline/delete bookings and rooms)
- Change name/studentId/email/password of a student and faculty member
